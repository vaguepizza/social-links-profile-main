## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Reset

### What I learned

This project helped me apply a media query to increase the madding on the card to match the desktop design. I also learnt how to match the design more efficiently using the design pictures.

### Useful resources
